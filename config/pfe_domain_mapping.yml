BlockL1-b11:
  display: Body functions
  definition: Body functions are the physiological functions of body systems (including
    psychological functions). Impairments are problems in body function or structure
    as a significant deviation or loss. Broad ranges of percentages are provided for
    those cases in which calibrated assessment instruments or other standards are
    available to quantify the impairment in body function. For example, when "no impairment"
    or "complete impairment" in body function is coded, this scaling may have margin
    of error of up to 5%. "Moderate impairment" is generally up to half of the scale
    of total impairment. The percentages are to be calibrated in different domains
    with reference to population standards as percentiles. For this quantification
    to be used in a uniform manner, assessment procedures need to be developed through
    research. For a further explanation of coding conventions in ICF, refer to Annex
    2.

  display: Activities and participation
  definition: 'Activity is the execution of a task or action by an individual. Participation
    is involvement in a life situation. Activity limitations are difficulties an individual
    may have in executing activities. Participation restrictions are problems an individual
    may experience in involvement in life situations. The domains for the Activities
    and Participation component are given in a single list that covers the full range
    of life areas (from basic learning and watching to composite areas such as social
    tasks). This component can be used to dedefinition activities (a) or participation
    (p) or both. The two qualifiers for the Activities and Participation component
    are the performance qualifier and the capacity qualifier. The performance qualifier
    describes what an individual does in his or her current environment. Because the
    current environment brings in a societal context, performance as recorded by this
    qualifier can also be understood as "involvement in a life situation" or "the
    lived experience" of people in the actual context in which they live. This context
    includes the environmental factors - all aspects of the physical, social and attitudinal
    world, which can be coded using the Environmental Factors component. The capacity
    qualifier describes an individual''s ability to execute a task or an action. This
    qualifier identifies the highest probable level of functioning that a person may
    reach in a given domain at a given moment. Capacity is measured in a uniform or
    standard environment, and thus reflects the environmentally adjusted ability of
    the individual. The Environmental Factors component can be used to describe the
    features of this uniform or standard environment. Both capacity and performance
    qualifiers can be used with and without assistive devices or personal assistance,
    and in accordance with the following scale:'
